When starting out in the UI program at Flatiron School, I knew that my art degree would be an invaluable resource to lean on. Color theory, composition layout, and various technologies were all concepts I was previously exposed to. Little did I know what the most important lesson I would come to rely on, was in fact, how to engage in a critique session.

It was the second year of my undergrad education. I was sitting in my weekly Friday critique for my 3D modeling class. The conversation started by one of the "star students" showing their work on the projector and all of my colleagues proceeding to praise their abilities. My professor stood up in front of the projector, turned to face our circle, and said "Starting now, if someone begins a comment with the phrase 'I like', they will lose points on their final grade."

Now, the participation in critique was mandatory. Everyone had to provide at least one comment a day, if not, they would suffer from a similar point deduction. Our professor kept a running tally as we discussed our pieces every week. But at this new turn of events, everyone fell silent, and you could physically feel the tension in the air. We all knew we had to speak, but didn't know what to say. She stood up again. "Ok, same rules apply, but for every minute of silence, everyone will lose points".

Finally, someone asked her what it is she wanted us to say, and she clarified;

> The worst thing you can do to an artist or an artwork is be indifferent to it. And that is what your silence conveys.

She went on to say that if all we have to say are positives, though, we as young artists could not grow. The comments we were to provide should be actionable and concise, and that did not mean we needed to be cruel.

We found ways to make positive comments without the dreaded words "I like". Phrases like "I appreciate" and "I recognize", while still being personal, are a bit more pointed, and that was the idea. You personally liking something does very little to a creation. It can't make it better. Telling a creator that you recognize a technique they tried or you appreciate a specific point of a work, now that is actionable and helpful. It tells the creator what not to touch. It signifies areas they have found success in and can move on to other studies. "I like" is just too subjective of a phrase to offer that kind of reassurance.

I never really saw the impact of what my professor meant until the first critique within my Flatiron program. While we were not "making art" in this specific instance, we were still creating in a learning environment, and therefore needed the review to become better. Indifference, even in terms of design, is still a terrible thing to be associated with.

But the process was overall frustrating. Many of my fellow students had never been in a setting like this before and we were all learning a new skill set at a very quick pace. The insecurity and vulnerability was palpable over the zoom calls, understandably so.

The critiques usually included all the big mistakes I had experienced in my undergrad; a lot of people "liked" things and a lot of silence filled the call when there was nothing to say. Many of my own personal designs usually received silence, and I did not know how to take that at first. But I will say, having been exposed to this lesson earlier, I found the silence infuriating. Moreso now than I did with my art. As the program continued, I found truly actionable feedback to be quite rare. And I did not have a caring professor this time to make sure that status changed.

Now, silence and positivity are not the only two mistakes I noticed within my feedback sessions. But this is supposed to be a blog post, not a novel. And they are by no means the worst mistakes to make. They are human mistakes. I made them myself, as seen by the reaction of my undergrad professor.

The worst mistake I recognized, and it's the most subtle of mistakes, is adding in "you" to any sort of critical feedback. Similar to "I" in "I like", it's too personal. But it doesn't have an air of subjective this time. It can actually be misconstrued as accusatory and make the recipient defensive.

The worst culprit I ever saw of this was actually an early instructor of mine in the aforementioned program. And he did this in every feedback session, whether verbal or written. But verbal feedback is probably the feedback we should be most attention to, especially as asynchronous communication becomes the norm within our work environments.

Now because I have had plenty of exposure to critique sessions in my time, I would not describe myself as "sensitive" to receiving harsh feedback. But it was the way this instructor phrased his reviews that made me instantly fall into despair whenever I received an email about a new submission. It was soul crushing, and it was something he could have easily fixed.

"Your wireframes should be at a higher quality and you should put some time into it." This is a mild example of some feedback. Now, reading this sentence, you may think this is just explaining the expectation or wireframes; they should be higher quality than what we've done previously and that means there should be more time spent on them. That may have been his intention with this sentence, a purely instructional statement. I, however, took it as "your wireframes aren't good enough and you clearly didn't spend that much time on it". Which I then took offense to.

Now, let's rewrite that sentence; "The wireframes should be a higher quality and need some more time spent on them." This is actionable. I know where I need to spend my time and edits. It's not as specific of feedback, so I as the creator am still left with some questions, but it's a start. Now I do not feel like I am being accused. I no longer could argue how much time I had already spent on them, and the feedback does not seem subjective. From an instructor perspective, my wireframes were almost there, but not quite. I could work with that. And it now has nothing to do with me personally. Just by simply removing the word "you".

So to cut this off, here are some of the above mentioned quick tips you can practice for better critiques (in list form);

1. **Don't use the phrase "I like"**. Find another way to convey you appreciate an aspect of the work without making it too subjective. The goal is to encourage the creator that something is working well and shouldn't be changed.
2. **Take "you" out of it**. To help your feedback to be objective and actionable, talk about the work and only the work, not the creator.
3. **Reread any written feedback before sending it off.** Simple edits could save a critical sentence from being taken as an offensive statement (It has saved me several times.) And try to imagine you receiving the feedback you are about to send. Empathy can go a long way.
4. **Try to be as specific as possible.** Leave the creator with as little questions as possible. This also leaves little room for subjectivity.
5. **Don't remain silent.** Your feedback is meant to be helpful, but that is up to the creator to decide if it truly is. If they don't agree with what they hear, they can choose not to take it. But they need to hear it to make that decision.
6. **Be kind.** But you can be kind and be critical. The creator will thank you for it.

Thanks for reading!
